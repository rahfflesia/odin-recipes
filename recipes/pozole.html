            with 1 clove of garlic, 1/4 piece of an onion (not diced), the bay leaves, salt and pepper. 
            Set aside 1/2 cup of the broth from cooking the pork.</li>
        <li>
            Once the meat is cooked through, remove the bay leave, onion, and garlic clove, 
            and add the hominy and bring to a boil for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare the guajillo chilies by removing the seeds and stem and boiling in water for 5-7 minutes or until soft. 
            Set aside for the next step.

        <li>
