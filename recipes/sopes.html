    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sopes is like a small thick corn tortilla with a border around the edges. This last part is formed right after cooking the sopes when the texture is soft enough to allow you to pinch the edges to form the border. 
        This border serves as a barrier to contain all the delicious toppings!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Masa harina</li>
        <li>Warm water</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Refried beans</li>
        <li>Lettuce finely shredded</li>
        <li>Mexican cheese queso fresco crumbled</li>
        <li>White onion finely chopped</li>
        <li>Mexican cream</li>
        <li>Spicy salsa</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk masa harina and salt together in a bowl. Stir in enough water until dough is smooth and holds together. </li>
        <li>Form dough into twelve 2-inch balls. Place balls onto parchment paper and flatten to 1/2-inch thick circles.</li>
        <li> Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry a few sopes at a time until lightly browned, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer with tongs to a paper towel-lined plate and let cool just until they can be handled, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Pinch the edges of each sope together to form a little boat. </li>
        <li>Return sopes to the hot oil and fry until golden and cooked through, 1 to 2 more minutes. Drain on paper towels. </li>
    </ol>
